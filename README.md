A React-based interactive city development simulation for Burnaby, BC, showcasing the impact of different facilities on urban indicators from 2025 to 2050.

---

## Overview

This project simulates the growth and development of Burnaby city by allowing users to place various facilities on a map within the city boundaries. The simulation models how these facilities influence key urban indicators such as population, traffic accidents, crime rates, housing satisfaction, unemployment, air quality, and inflation over a 25-year horizon.

Users can:

- Select and place buildings like Markets, Schools, Hospitals, and more on a detailed Burnaby map.
- View baseline data (2025), forecasted trends (2050 projected), and user-driven scenarios (2050 user scenario).
- Analyze a summary of overall policy impacts and detailed facility-level effects.
- Access a legend explaining the positive and negative impacts of each facility.
- Visualize placed buildings on the map with distinct icons and adjust the view.
- Simulate and review results to inform urban planning and policy decisions.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Leaflet.js-powered map with polygon boundaries for Burnaby.
- **Facility Selection:** Users can select from a set of buildings with associated costs and impacts.
- **Budget Management:** Place buildings within a budget constraint.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Calculates changes in urban indicators based on placed facilities.
- **Detailed Reports:** Tabular summaries showing indicator comparisons and facility impact details.
- **Policy Summaries:** Automatically generated overall and facility-specific policy suggestion summaries.
- **Legend:** Clarifies benefits and drawbacks for each facility type.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, clean interface with easy navigation.
